I decided to do not to use any JS's frameworks because the graphic project is very CSS friendly and I needed more vanilla JS training.
If you want to see my projects where I used React check my GH repository:
- https://github.com/Voland91/servers-manager - React + TypeScript
- https://github.com/Voland91/kudos - React + Redux
- https://github.com/code-in-space/project-Rakieta - React + TypeScript + StoryBook (it's an unfinished project I was working with my friend, designed by myself in Adobe XD).

In this project, I decided to use Parcel to write styles in SCSS and then to build the page in the end.


To run this project locally you need to download the repository and in the main folder type "npm i" in the terminal to install all dependencies. Then you need to type "npm start" to start it at http://localhost:1234/
